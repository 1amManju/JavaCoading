##  How My code works
    1. There are three different classes
    2. Song class, Users class and UserPlayList class.
    3. Run UserPlayList class to get the Results
    4. I have created 2 Users User1 and User2 and User1 songs are S1, S2 & S3 and User2 songs are M1, M2 & M3.
    5. When you run the UserPlayList class, In run time you need to Specify particular User to get his/her PlayList and You can add a new song to his Play List in run time.
    6. When you add a new song then the oldest song will be removed and a new song will be added to the playlist.
    7. I have written while loop to iterate for 4 times so that you can add multiple songs to the specific User


####  UserPlayList :- Main Class
      After Execution You Have to give the value in Run Time.
      1. First You have to Pass User1 or User2 to get their respective Playlist
      2. After Giving User, you have to specify new song and that will be added to the play list.
